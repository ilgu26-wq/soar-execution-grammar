# EXP-36: Shadow Geometry

## Question
Can alpha be observed through its structural shadow rather than directly?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, direct alpha measurement
- Varied: Shadow measurement vs direct measurement

## Signals
Shadow information content, alpha detection via shadow

## Result
Alpha reveals itself through shadow, not light. Shadow geometry contains alpha information.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Shadow observation is a valid and potentially superior alpha detection method.
