# EXP-60: Posterior Shape Analysis

## Question
What is the shape and maturity distribution of the 57-bin posterior?

## Protocol
- Fixed: v3_runtime, 57-bin structure
- Varied: Analysis parameters

## Signals
Maturity %, UNDECIDED count, posterior shape statistics

## Result
57 bins: 70.2% maturity, 0 UNDECIDED bins. Posterior shape is well-formed.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Posterior topology is stable. No bins are stuck in indeterminate states.
