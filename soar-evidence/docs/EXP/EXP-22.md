# EXP-22: Alpha Termination Point

## Question
Is alpha death a discrete event or a continuous process?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, alpha lifecycle data
- Varied: Termination detection methods

## Signals
ATP timing, energy at termination, transition dynamics

## Result
Death is a process, not an event. ATP shows gradual energy decay before terminal state.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Alpha termination is observable before it completes. Early detection is possible.
