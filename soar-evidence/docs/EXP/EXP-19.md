# EXP-19: Contested Micro Orbit

## Question
How should contested (ambiguous) micro orbits be resolved?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, gauge lock v2
- Varied: Contested orbit resolution strategies

## Signals
Resolution accuracy, false classification rate

## Result
Contested orbits resolved through structural priority rules. Ambiguity is a property of the observation, not the alpha.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Contested orbit resolution codified. All orbits have a deterministic classification.
