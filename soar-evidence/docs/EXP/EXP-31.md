# EXP-31: Relative Observer Frame

## Question
What does stability look like in a co-moving reference frame?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, absolute frame measurements
- Varied: Reference frame: absolute vs co-moving

## Signals
Apparent stability, true drift, frame-dependent observations

## Result
Stability in co-moving frame can be 'weightless' — apparent stability masks real drift.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Frame choice matters. Co-moving stability is not true stability.
