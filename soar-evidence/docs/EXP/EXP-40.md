# EXP-40: ARG Attach Simulation

## Question
Does attachment to an alpha trigger a phase transition?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, shadow geometry, phase transition detection
- Varied: Attachment event analysis

## Signals
Phase transition rate at attachment, system state change

## Result
Attachment triggers phase transition. The act of commitment changes the system state.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Observation is not passive at the point of commitment. Attachment is a structural event.
