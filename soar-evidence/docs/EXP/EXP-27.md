# EXP-27: SBII (Structure-Based Info Inequality)

## Question
Is there an information inequality between structural observation and direct measurement?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, dual measurement system
- Varied: Structural vs direct measurement comparison

## Signals
Information content per measurement type, predictive accuracy

## Result
Structure-based observation contains information not available in direct measurement.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
SBII confirmed. Structural observation is a privileged information channel.
