# EXP-28: Geometry Drift

## Question
Does the geometric structure of alpha space drift over time?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, geometry measurement
- Varied: Measurement window and drift detection

## Signals
Drift magnitude, drift rate, structural stability

## Result
Geometric drift measured. Structure is locally stable but globally drifting.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Drift exists but is slow. Local stability enables reliable observation windows.
