# EXP-16: Alpha Orbit

## Question
Can alpha orbits be classified and committed irreversibly?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, FCL from EXP-15
- Varied: Orbit classification parameters

## Signals
Orbit closure rate, win rate per orbit type

## Result
AOCL (Alpha Orbit Commitment Law) established. Orbit classification is irreversible.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Orbit commitment confirmed. Closed orbits correlate with high win rate.
