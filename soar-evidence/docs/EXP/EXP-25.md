# EXP-25: Alpha Census

## Question
What is the population topology of active alphas across microstates?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, microstate definition
- Varied: Census measurement parameters

## Signals
Population distribution, density per microstate, survival rates

## Result
Population topology mapped. Alpha density varies dramatically across microstates.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Microstate population structure is non-uniform. Some states are structurally favorable.
