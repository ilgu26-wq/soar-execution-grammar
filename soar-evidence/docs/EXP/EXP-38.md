# EXP-38: Phase Transition

## Question
Are phase transitions shadow-driven or energy-driven?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, shadow and energy measurements
- Varied: Transition attribution: shadow vs energy

## Signals
Transition timing relative to shadow vs energy signals

## Result
Phase transitions are shadow-driven. Shadow signals lead energy signals.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Shadow geometry is the primary observation channel for phase transitions.
