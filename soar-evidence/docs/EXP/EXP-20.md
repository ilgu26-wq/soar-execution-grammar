# EXP-20: Pheromone Drift

## Question
Does pheromone drift (PDL) measure meaningful structural change?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, orbit classification
- Varied: PDL measurement window and sensitivity

## Signals
PDL magnitude, correlation with regime changes

## Result
PDL drift measurement captures structural change. High PDL precedes regime transitions.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
PDL is a valid leading indicator of regime change. Observation channel confirmed.
