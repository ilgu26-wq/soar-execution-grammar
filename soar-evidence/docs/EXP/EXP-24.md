# EXP-24: Central Axis Drift

## Question
Does the central axis track energy position or magnitude?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, axis measurement system
- Varied: Axis tracking mode: position vs magnitude

## Signals
Axis predictive power, correlation with alpha state

## Result
Axis tracks energy position, not magnitude. Position is more informative than size.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Central axis is a position indicator. Magnitude-based analysis is misleading.
