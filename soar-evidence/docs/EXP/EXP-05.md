# EXP-05: v2 with v1 Overlay

## Question
Does overlaying v1 logic onto v2 improve performance?

## Protocol
- Fixed: v2 engine as base
- Varied: v1 overlay ON/OFF

## Signals
PF, Net PnL, PnL retention ratio

## Result
v1 overlay kills PnL — only 73% retention. Overlay is destructive.

## Verdict
❌ REJECTED

## Implication
v1 overlay rejected. v2 must run SOLO without legacy logic.
