# EXP-64b: JR Boundary Compression

## Question
Can judgment region boundaries be compressed for efficiency?

## Protocol
- Fixed: 57-bin MDU, Sharp Boundary
- Varied: Boundary compression ratio

## Signals
Emergence detection under compression, false negative rate

## Result
Emergence is data-driven — compression may miss emerging patterns.

## Verdict
⚠️ PARTIAL

## Implication
Boundary compression is risky. Emergence detection requires full resolution.
