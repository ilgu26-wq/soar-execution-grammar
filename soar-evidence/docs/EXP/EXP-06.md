# EXP-06: Trade Count Calibration

## Question
Does calibrating v1 trade count make it competitive with v2?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Market data, evaluation metrics
- Varied: v1 calibration parameters

## Signals
PF, Max DD%, trade count alignment

## Result
Even calibrated, v1 shows worse DD than v2. v2 SOLO confirmed.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
v2 SOLO is the final production configuration. No v1 involvement.
