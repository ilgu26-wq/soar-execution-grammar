# EXP-23: Alpha Energy Trajectory

## Question
What happens after energy reaches zero?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, energy measurement
- Varied: Post-zero-energy alpha behavior

## Signals
Recovery rate after E≤0, subsequent win rate

## Result
E≤0 once → near-certain death. Recovery from zero energy is statistically negligible.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Energy collapse is irreversible. E≤0 is a terminal signal for alpha lifecycle.
