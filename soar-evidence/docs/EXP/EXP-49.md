# EXP-49: IMMORTAL-tight

## Question
Does tightening the IMMORTAL boundary improve precision?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, Sharp Boundary
- Varied: IMMORTAL boundary tightness

## Signals
Precision, recall, FE rate at different tightness levels

## Result
Tighter boundary improves precision without sacrificing IMMORTAL capture.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
IMMORTAL boundary can be tightened for better precision. Recall is maintained.
