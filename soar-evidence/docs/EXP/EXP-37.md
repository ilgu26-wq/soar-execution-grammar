# EXP-37: Shadow Accumulation

## Question
Does shadow accumulation precede structural phase transitions?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, shadow measurement from EXP-36
- Varied: Accumulation measurement window

## Signals
Shadow density before/after phase transitions, lead time

## Result
Shadow accumulation consistently precedes phase transitions. It is a leading indicator.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Shadow accumulation → phase transition is a causal chain, not correlation.
