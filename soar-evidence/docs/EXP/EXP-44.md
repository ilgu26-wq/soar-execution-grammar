# EXP-44: ECL Execution

## Question
Is energy conserved within the decision system?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, energy measurement
- Varied: Energy flow tracking through decision pipeline

## Signals
Energy balance, conservation violations, PnL conversion rate

## Result
Energy conservation law confirmed. Only execution converts energy to PnL. Judgment does not alter energy.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
ECL is a law. Reward shaping is forbidden — it would violate conservation.
