# EXP-64c: PDL Directed Pheromone

## Question
Can PDL pheromone signals be directed to improve infant bin learning?

## Protocol
- Fixed: 57-bin MDU, PDL measurement
- Varied: Directed pheromone routing

## Signals
Infant bin learning rate, E- event distribution

## Result
NO EFFECT. E- events occur only in mature bins. Directed pheromone cannot reach infant bins.

## Verdict
❌ NO EFFECT

## Implication
PDL pheromone is not a viable acceleration mechanism for infant bins.
