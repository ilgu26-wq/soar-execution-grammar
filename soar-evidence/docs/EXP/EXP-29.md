# EXP-29: Micro Origin

## Question
Can the origin of each microstate be traced to structural properties?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, microstate classification
- Varied: Origin tracing depth

## Signals
Origin attribution accuracy, structural property coverage

## Result
Microstate origins traced to structural properties. Each microstate has identifiable genesis.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Microstates are not arbitrary — they emerge from structural properties.
