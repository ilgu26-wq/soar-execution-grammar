# EXP-15: Failure Commitment

## Question
Should failed alpha classifications be irreversible?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, alpha lifecycle tracking
- Varied: Reversible vs irreversible failure classification

## Signals
Re-entry rate after failure, PnL of re-entries

## Result
Re-entries after failure classification are consistently unprofitable. FCL (Failure Commitment Law) confirmed.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Once classified as failed, an alpha stays failed. Irreversibility is correct.
