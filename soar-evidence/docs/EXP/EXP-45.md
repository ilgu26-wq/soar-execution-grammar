# EXP-45: Energy Exit

## Question
How does energy dissipate when an alpha terminates?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, ECL from EXP-44
- Varied: Exit mechanics observation

## Signals
Energy dissipation rate, exit trajectory shape

## Result
Exit energy follows predictable dissipation curves. Energy is not destroyed — it disperses.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Exit mechanics are observable and predictable. Confirms ECL.
