# EXP-21: PDL RL Dataset

## Question
Can PDL observations be compiled into a reinforcement learning dataset?

## Protocol
- Fixed: PDL measurements from EXP-20
- Varied: Dataset construction parameters

## Signals
Dataset completeness, state-action coverage

## Result
RL dataset generated and sealed. Contains full state-action-reward tuples.

## Verdict
✅ SEALED

## Implication
Dataset sealed for potential future use. Not consumed by current runtime.
