# EXP-03: Kill Switch

## Question
Does disabling any constitution law cause system collapse?

## Protocol
- Fixed: SOAR grammar, market data
- Varied: Constitution laws R1-R5 disabled individually

## Signals
System stability, PF, drawdown under each disable scenario

## Result
Disabling any single law causes catastrophic performance degradation. R5 (all-on) is confirmed.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Constitution is a lock — all laws must be ON. D4 destruction test proven.
