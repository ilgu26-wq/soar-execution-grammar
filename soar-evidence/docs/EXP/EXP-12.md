# EXP-12: Regime Condition Resolution

## Question
How do regime and condition interact in the weight pipeline?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, weight pipeline
- Varied: Regime × Condition combinations

## Signals
Interaction effects, performance per regime-condition pair

## Result
Regime × Condition interaction mapped. Some combinations are structurally incompatible.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Regime-condition interaction is a structural property, not a parameter to tune.
