# EXP-17: Observer Gauge

## Question
Can observation instruments be calibrated as gauges?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, existing observation channels
- Varied: Gauge measurement parameters

## Signals
Gauge stability, reading variance, calibration drift

## Result
Gauge instrumentation successful. Observation channels can be read as calibrated measurements.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Observer gauges established. Proceed to gauge stabilization (EXP-18a).
