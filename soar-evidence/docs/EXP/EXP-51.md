# EXP-51: Cross-Market Validation

## Question
Do SOAR structural laws generalize across markets?

## Protocol
- Fixed: SOAR grammar, parameter settings
- Varied: Market: NQ, ES, BTC

## Signals
PF, Win Rate, law compliance per market

## Result
NQ laws preserved. ES and BTC need separate calibration — structure exists but parameters differ.

## Verdict
⚠️ PARTIAL

## Implication
NQ is the reference market. Cross-market requires calibration, not redesign.
