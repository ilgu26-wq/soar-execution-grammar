# EXP-30: Energy–Axis Drift

## Question
Does axis position dominate axis magnitude in predicting alpha state?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, axis measurement
- Varied: Prediction models: position-only vs magnitude-only vs combined

## Signals
Prediction accuracy per model type

## Result
Position > magnitude. Axis position alone is more predictive than magnitude alone.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Confirms EXP-24 independently. Position-based analysis is correct.
