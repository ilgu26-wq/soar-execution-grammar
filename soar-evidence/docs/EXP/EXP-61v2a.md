# EXP-61v2a: Forbidden Band

## Question
Is the 57-bin structure the minimal distinct unit (MDU)?

## Protocol
- Fixed: 57-bin structure
- Varied: Merge/split/redesign attempts

## Signals
Any structural modification impact on FE and capture

## Result
57-bin = MDU. Cannot merge = structure is already optimal. No merge, split, or redesign improves the structure.

## Verdict
❌ SEALED

## Implication
MDU Law established. 57 bins is the final topology. Only α,β values may evolve.
