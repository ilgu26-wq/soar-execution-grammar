# EXP-34: Frame Switch

## Question
What happens when observation switches between coordinate frames?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, multi-frame observation
- Varied: Frame switching frequency and conditions

## Signals
Information loss per switch, observation continuity

## Result
Stable coordinates can hide information. Frame switching reveals hidden structure.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Frame switching is informative but costly. Use sparingly.
