# EXP-35: Frame Cost

## Question
What is the cost of switching observation frames?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, frame switch mechanism
- Varied: Frame switching frequency

## Signals
Observation gap duration, information loss magnitude

## Result
Frame switching has a measurable cost in observation continuity and information loss.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Frame cost is real. Optimize switching frequency to minimize information loss.
