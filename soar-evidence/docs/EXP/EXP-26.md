# EXP-26: Interference

## Question
Do concurrent alphas interfere with each other?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, multi-alpha tracking
- Varied: Alpha density and overlap measurements

## Signals
Interference magnitude, performance impact of overlapping alphas

## Result
Interference patterns catalogued. High-density regions show measurable interference.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Alpha interference exists and is measurable. Density management may be valuable.
