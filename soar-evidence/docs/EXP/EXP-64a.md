# EXP-64a: Observation Scheduling

## Question
Can observation frequency be reduced for mature bins?

## Protocol
- Fixed: 57-bin MDU, bin maturity from EXP-63
- Varied: Observation probability for mature vs infant bins

## Signals
Performance under reduced observation, savings

## Result
Safe to reduce observation to p=0.25 for mature bins. No performance degradation.

## Verdict
⚠️ PARTIAL

## Implication
Observation scheduling is viable for mature bins. Infant bins need full observation.
