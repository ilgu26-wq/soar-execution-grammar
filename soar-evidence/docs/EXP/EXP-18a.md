# EXP-18a: Gauge Lock v2

## Question
Can gauge readings be stabilized for consistent orbit evaluation?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Observer gauge from EXP-17
- Varied: Lock mechanism parameters, stabilization window

## Signals
Gauge reading variance before/after lock, orbit evaluation consistency

## Result
Gauge lock v2 stabilizes orbit evaluation. Reading variance reduced significantly.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Stabilized gauges enable consistent orbit classification across market conditions.
