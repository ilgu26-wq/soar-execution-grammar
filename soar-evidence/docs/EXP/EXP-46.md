# EXP-46: Observer Learning

## Question
Can observer calibration improve judge accuracy?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, judge parameters
- Varied: Observer calibration methods

## Signals
Judge accuracy before/after calibration

## Result
Observer calibration sealed. Contributed to judge accuracy but is not part of runtime.

## Verdict
✅ SEALED

## Implication
Observer learning is an offline calibration tool. Sealed — never imported by runtime.
