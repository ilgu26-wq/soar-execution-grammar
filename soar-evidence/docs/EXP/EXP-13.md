# EXP-13: Motion Watchdog

## Question
Can motion (price velocity) be instrumented as an observation channel?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, existing observation channels
- Varied: Motion measurement parameters

## Signals
Motion signal quality, correlation with alpha state

## Result
Motion observation instrumented successfully. Motion correlates with alpha lifecycle stage.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Motion is an observable. Proceed to motion-based penalties (EXP-14).
