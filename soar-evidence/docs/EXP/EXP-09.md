# EXP-09: Alpha Condition Refinement

## Question
Can alpha conditions be refined into a systematic weight pipeline?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, boundary parameters
- Varied: Alpha condition weights and thresholds

## Signals
Signal quality distribution, weight pipeline stability

## Result
Structural weight pipeline established. Conditions map to observable alpha properties.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
Weight pipeline confirmed. Proceed to proposal-level filtering (EXP-10).
