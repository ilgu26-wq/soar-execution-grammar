# EXP-32: Orbit Closure

## Question
Does orbit closure (AOC) predict win rate?

## Protocol
- Fixed: Core v2, orbit tracking
- Varied: Closure detection parameters

## Signals
Win rate for closed vs open orbits

## Result
Closed orbit = high win rate. Open orbits are unstable and unpredictable.

## Verdict
✅ PASS

## Implication
AOC is a strong structural predictor. Orbit closure is a prerequisite for reliable execution.
