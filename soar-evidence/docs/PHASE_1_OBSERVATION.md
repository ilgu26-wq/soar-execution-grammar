# Phase 1 — Observation (EXP-01 ~ EXP-40)

> "We mapped the territory before drawing the map."

## Summary

Phase 1 is pure observation and structural discovery. No learning, no optimization, no parameter tuning. Every experiment in this phase asks: "What is the structure of alpha?" — not "How do we profit from it?"

## Key Discoveries

### Foundation (EXP-01 ~ 08)

The SOAR execution grammar was validated against raw (unfiltered) execution. EXP-01 showed that structural filtering alone reduces drawdown and loss streaks. EXP-02 confirmed that every gate component contributes — removing any single component degrades performance. EXP-03 proved the constitution's kill switch: disabling any law causes system collapse.

Core v2 was established as the production engine (EXP-04: PF 1.15 vs v1 PF 0.94). Attempts to overlay v1 logic onto v2 were rejected (EXP-05: 73% PnL retention — overlay kills performance). v2 SOLO was confirmed in EXP-06.

Prop-firm deployment compatibility was verified (EXP-07), and boundary parameters were shown to be robust under perturbation (EXP-08).

### Structural Weight Pipeline (EXP-09 ~ 14)

Alpha conditions were refined into a weight pipeline: condition refinement (EXP-09), proposal shaping (EXP-10), regime-condition interaction (EXP-12), motion observation (EXP-13), and motion-based penalties (EXP-14).

### Irreversible Classification (EXP-15 ~ 16)

Failure Commitment (EXP-15) established the FCL — once an alpha is classified as failed, the classification is irreversible. Alpha Orbit (EXP-16) introduced the AOCL orbit commitment: once an orbit is classified, it stays classified.

### Observation Instrumentation (EXP-17 ~ 20)

The observer system was instrumented: gauge measurement (EXP-17), gauge lock stabilization (EXP-18a), contested orbit resolution (EXP-19), and pheromone drift measurement (EXP-20).

### Alpha Physics (EXP-21 ~ 32)

This is the core physics archive:

- **EXP-22 (ATP)**: "Death is a process, not an event." Alpha termination is gradual, not sudden.
- **EXP-23 (Energy Trajectory)**: Once E ≤ 0, near-certain death follows. Energy collapse is irreversible.
- **EXP-24 (Central Axis)**: The axis tracks energy position, not magnitude. Position matters more than size.
- **EXP-25 (Census)**: Population topology mapped across all microstates.
- **EXP-30 (Energy-Axis Drift)**: Axis position > axis magnitude — confirmed independently.
- **EXP-31 (Relative Frame)**: Stability in a co-moving frame can be "weightless" — apparent stability masks real drift.
- **EXP-32 (Orbit Closure)**: Closed orbit = high win rate. Open orbits are unstable.

### Shadow & Frame Theory (EXP-34 ~ 40)

- **EXP-34–35 (Frame Switch/Cost)**: Stable coordinates can hide information. Frame switching has a measurable cost.
- **EXP-36–38 (Shadow Geometry)**: "Alpha reveals itself through shadow, not light." Shadow accumulation precedes phase transitions. Phase transitions are shadow-driven, not energy-driven.
- **EXP-39–40 (Relative Gate / ARG Attach)**: ALLOW = living worldline. Attachment to an alpha triggers a phase transition — the act of commitment changes the system state.

## Phase 1 Conclusion

By the end of Phase 1, the structural territory was fully mapped. Every observation confirmed: **alpha has physics.** It has energy, orbits, shadows, phase transitions, and irreversible death. None of this requires learning or optimization — it is inherent in the structure.

Phase 2 would connect these observations to execution decisions.
