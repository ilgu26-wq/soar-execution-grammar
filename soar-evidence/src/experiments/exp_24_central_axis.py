EXP-24: Central Axis Drift & Orbit Reclassification
=====================================================
"Where does alpha get captured"

MOTIVATION:
 EXP-23from energy flow alpha's/of fate/destiny determinationdone Confirmeddid.
 Now remain Question: "that all momentat, judgment's/of reference/criteriaaxis where was it?"

CENTRAL AXIS:
 CA(k) = <E_total(k), E_orbit(k), E_stability(k), leader(k)>
 ΔCA = CA(k+δ) - CA(k-δ) (δ=1 bar)

EVENTS DETECTED:
 AOCL_COMMIT — alpha orbit crystallization (stab_aocl_oct)
 FCL_COMMIT — failure orbit crystallization (stab_fcl_oct)
 ATP — alpha termination point
 ZOMBIE_REVIVAL — energy returns positive after collapse
 CROSSOVER — leader flips (AOCL↔FCL)

DESIGN:
 Pure measurement. Gate/Alpha/Size completely untouched.

RESULTS:
 Money preserved:
 Net PnL: $1,200.00 [IDENTICAL]
 WR: 39.2% [IDENTICAL]
 PF: 1.28 [IDENTICAL]
 Max DD: 0.42% [IDENTICAL]
 Gate: UNTOUCHED

 === Dominant Movement by Fate ===
 IMMORTAL: ENERGY_NO_ORBIT (22/47) WR=95.7%

KEY FINDINGS:

 Q1. alpha energy not... but axis Movementto/as born?
 → NO. Low E + High ΔO = WR 0.0% (n=15)
 → High E + High ΔO = WR 67.7% (n=93)
 → Conclusion: energy if none axis Movementonly with Impossibledo.
 → energy first, axis follows.

 Q2. ZOMBIE axis restorationis it? new axis Generationis it??
 → Axis restored (ΔO>0): 5
 → New axis (ΔO≤0): 15
 → Conclusion: ZOMBIE most "new axis Generation"is.
 → existing alpha axis restored not... but, external energy new orbit onlyfeels.
 → trades "resurrection" not... but "rebirth"is.

 Q3. CONTESTED wins's/of axis Maintained
 → CONTESTED-ALPHA: 29 trades, axis held to end: 29, lost: 0
 → WR 100%
 → Conclusion: CONTESTEDonce the axis is captured, to the end Maintainedbecomes.
 → axis one/a time fixedif becomes irreversibleever/instanceis.

PHYSICAL LAWS (EXP-24 derivation):

 1. CROSSOVER = 0 (no axis flipping)
 → Once direction is set, it never flips
 → trades irreversiblenature/property's/of the strongest form

 2. AOCL_COMMIT vs FCL_COMMIT: exactly opposite signs
 → AOCL: ΔE=+7.22, ΔO=+0.513
 → FCL: ΔE=-4.25, ΔO=-0.423
 → The two commits push the axis in exactly opposite directions
 → symmetry breaking

 3. ZOMBIE_REVIVAL's/of ΔE_axis = +30.98 (most large Movement)
 → Energy injection at the moment of revival is most explosive
 → However ΔE_orbit = +0.120 (orbit barely moves)
 → State with energy but no orbit
 → Therefore Revival WR = 24.1% (mostly again dies)

 4. IMMORTAL's dominant movement = ENERGY_NO_ORBIT (22/47)
 → energy hasonly orbit Movement is small
 → IMMORTAL'the axis was in its place from the start'
 → Movementwill Needed did not have — trades "Stable's/of evidence"

 5. SURVIVED's/of dominant movement = ALPHA_LOCK (11/21)
 → After passing competition, the axis 'locks'
 → LOCK = ΔE>0 AND ΔO>0 AND ΔS>0 (all directions positive)
 → The strongest lock — this is the physical Result

 6. TERMINATED/STILLBORN = MIXED (dominant)
 → Axis not fixed in any direction
 → 'No direction' = 'dead'

 7. STILLBORN AOCL_COMMIT 0 trades
 → No orbit determination at all
 → trades "axis formation failure" — born beforeat already axis did not have

ARCHITECTURE INSIGHT:

 "CROSSOVER = 0"

 trades system's/of most important structural Discoverywork/day number/can exists.
 Once direction is set, the axis never flips.

 trades It is not what Gate protects.
 Not proposed by the Alpha Layer either.
 Not decided by the Judge either.

 trades It is a property of the structure itself.
 irreversiblenature/property design not... but observationbecome physicsIt is a law..

THEIR WORDS:
 "Once the axis is captured, it never flips.
 CROSSOVER = 0.
 trades This is not a rule, but a natural law.

 ZOMBIE not resurrection but rebirth.
 energy is newly injected, but orbit is newly created.

 CONTESTED-ALPHAonce it grabs the axis, it never lets go.
 29before 29wins, axis Maintainedrate 100%.

 trades not a decision system.
 trades determination space's/of physicsstudyis."
