EXP-31: Relative Observer Frame Test (observer coordinate frame relativity)
===================================================
"How does the axis appear depending on who observes it?"

MOTIVATION:
 EXP-30from energy among axis ATP before afterto/as Movementdo thing observation.
 But that was from the 'absolute observer' perspective.
 observer coordinate frameHow does the same phenomenon appear when changed?

DESIGN:
 3 observer frame:

 Frame-0: Absolute Frame (never coordinates)
 RC space reference/criteria, energy among centroid
 EXP-30's/of A_E youto/as

 Frame-1: Alpha-Comoving Frame (alpha co-movement coordinates)
 reference/criteriapoint = entry time RC position
 ΔRC = RC_t − RC_entry
 "alpha self's/of perspectivefrom if you look how much Stableis it??"

 Frame-2: Market-Local Frame (market local coordinates)
 reference/criteriapoint = window within market centroid
 "market cluster versus/compared to alpha whereto/as Movementdo?"

 Measurement:
 Δθ_E(frame): consecutive winalsoright axis rotation
 OSS_E(frame): axis Stablenature/property = 1 − (Δθ / 90)

RESULTS:
 Money preserved:
 Net PnL: $1,200.00 [IDENTICAL]
 WR: 39.2% [IDENTICAL]
 Max DD: 0.42% [IDENTICAL]
 Gate: UNTOUCHED
 Execution: ZERO changes — observation-only

 === Frame-wise Axis Statistics ===

 Frame Δθ_mean Δθ_max OSS_mean
 Absolute (Frame-0) 21.38° 55.10° 0.7624
 Alpha-Comoving (Frame-1) 0.00° 0.00° 1.0000
 Market-Local (Frame-2) 39.51° 109.49° 0.5649

 → Frame-1 (alpha co-movement)from axis completely Stable (OSS=1.0000)
 → Frame-2 (market local) where the axis shakes the most (39.51°)

 === ATP-Aligned by Frame & Fate ===

 Absolute (Frame-0):
 ZOMBIE: Pre OSS=0.757 At OSS=0.783 Post OSS=0.767
 TERMINATED: Pre OSS=0.758 At OSS=0.762 Post OSS=0.758
 STILLBORN: Pre OSS=0.746 At OSS=0.793 Post OSS=0.740

 Alpha-Comoving (Frame-1):
 ALL fates: OSS=1.000 everywhere — perfect Stable

 Market-Local (Frame-2):
 ZOMBIE: Pre OSS=0.559 At OSS=0.612 Post OSS=0.556
 TERMINATED: Pre OSS=0.558 At OSS=0.560 Post OSS=0.553
 STILLBORN: Pre OSS=0.531 At OSS=0.583 Post OSS=0.570

 === Hypothesis Test ===

 H-31a (TERMINATED unstable in all frames): PARTIAL
 Frame-0 OSS: 0.758 (unstable ✓)
 Frame-1 OSS: 1.000 (stable — self coordinatesatline Stable)
 Frame-2 OSS: 0.556 (unstable ✓)
 → Frame-1fromonly Stable. This is obviousone/a Result profoundone/a Result:
 "die alphaalso self coordinatesfrom Stableis."

 H-31b (ZOMBIE stable in Alpha-Comoving): SUPPORTED ✓
 Frame-0 OSS: 0.765 → Frame-1 OSS: 1.000
 Δ(F1-F0): +0.235
 → "ZOMBIE shakes thing observation effectand.
 self coordinatesfrom completely Stable."

 H-31c (SURVIVED/CONTESTED stable in Market-Local): INSUFFICIENT DATA

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:

 Key discovery: All axes perfectly stable in Alpha-Comoving frame.
 This is mathematically obvious, but physically profound.

 meaning:
 1. alpha self self's/of coordinate framefrom never does not shake does not
 2. never coordinatesfrom's/of 'non-/fireStable' observationand alpha's/of relative motion
 3. market local coordinatesfrom most non-/fireStable → market alpha shakes what not... but,
 alpha moving in a direction different from the market

 Conclusion:
 "death never coordinates's/of collapseknow, self coordinates's/of collapse .
 observation if different same alpha both alive and dead.
 This is judgment system's/of relativityis."
