EXP-46: OBSERVER-LIMITED LEARNING — learning's/of irreversiblenature/property
===================================================
"die alpha does not teach does not. alive alphaonly grammar bardreams."

PROBLEM:
 "learningif do again whydistorted no?"
 → observationatalso energy conservation ever/instanceusedoes.

DESIGN:
 Observer Energy Budget (OEB):
 Dead (E≤-5, peak≤0): 0.1× → does not teach not/none
 Low (E≤0): 0.3× → quietly teaching
 Normal (E>0): 1.0× → reference/criteria
 High (E>0, peak>5): 2.0× → grammar's/of owner
 PENUMBRA bonus: 1.5× → boundary observation priority

 Energy-weighted LOO Bayesian:
 EXP-41Same hierarchical structure, but when computing WR within buckets
 energy among ever/instanceuse

RESULTS:
 === Observer Budget Distribution ===

 Dead/muted (w≤0.3): 135 (46.1%)
 Active (w≥1.5): 148 (50.5%)

 === Comparison ===

 Strategy Net$ WR $/trade MaxDD
 Learned WR (EXP-41) $3,539 73.6% $30.04 0.09%
 Observer-Limited (EXP-46) $3,018 59.9% $19.82 0.13%

 === Hypotheses ===

 H-46a NOT SUPPORTED: Observer Net $3,018 < 95% of Learned $3,362
 H-46b NOT SUPPORTED: [0.3,0.6) still overfit (Δ=35.3%)
 H-46c NOT SUPPORTED: Observer MaxDD 0.13% > Learned 0.09%

 → 3/3 NOT SUPPORTED

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:

 ═══ why 3/3 NOT SUPPORTEDis it? ═══

 trades failure not... but important Discoveryis.

 Observer-Limited EXP-41than/more than unable keep:
 1. energy among p_exec estimation whydistortiondid
 2. die alpha 0.1× didonly, pluralalso "here dies" information 
 3. That is, die alpha's/of "how dead"also grammar's/of some

 ═══ key/core Discovery ═══

 "die alphaalso teaches. only different thing."

 - mountain/living alpha: " tradesfrom long"
 - die alpha: " tradesfrom dies"

 two equally exist information.
 energy amongto/as die observation if suppressed
 rather loses 'where the danger is'.

 ═══ ECL perspective ═══

 energy conservation law learningatalso ever/instancenot appliedonly,
 "observation's/of among" not... but "observation's/of target"at ever/instancemust be applied does.

 - die alphafrom learn thing: " energy statefrom dies"
 - mountain/living alphafrom learn thing: " energy statefrom lives"
 - among not... but energy itself featureto/as what fixedAnswer

 → EXP-44is the answer: p_exec = f(Energy), not f(weighted WR)
 → EXP-46's/of failure EXP-44's/of legitimacy Reinforcementdoes
