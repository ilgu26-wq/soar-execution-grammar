EXP-39: Relative Gate Shadow Test
===================================================
"already die alpha's/of execution always 's/of worldlineat exists."

MOTIVATION:
 EXP-38 Proofone/a thing: "alpha emergence phase transition."
 EXP-39's/of Question: Gate alpha's/of relative coordinate frameto/as if moved,
 "already ended alpha" death beforeat to identify number/can exist?

 ARG (Alpha-Relative Gate) observation beforeto/as definitionand do,
 "If Gate had existed at this time?' is computed only retrospectively.
 executionat influence none.

DESIGN (observationonly):
 ARG-DENY trades (OR — is onealso if patient DENY):
 1. ENERGY_COLLAPSE: E_total ≤ 0 (energy collapse)
 2. FAILED_OPEN: ATP fired & AOC undecided
 3. FCL_EARLY_DEATH: FCL-first & alpha_lifespan ≤ 2
 4. AEP_DOWN_JUMP: |ΔAEP| > 0.15, direction DOWN
 5. CLEAN_SHADOW_CONSECUTIVE: before ≥2 trade consecutive CLEAN_SHADOW

 Group A = ARG-DENY (6 trades among is onealso applicable)
 Group B = ARG-ALLOW (which/what tradesatalso does not apply not/none)

RESULTS:
 Money preserved:
 Net PnL: $1,200.00 [IDENTICAL]
 WR: 39.2% [IDENTICAL]
 Max DD: 0.42% [IDENTICAL]
 Gate: UNTOUCHED

 ★★★ 1/4 hypothesis SUPPORTED — the rest 3's/of "failure" more important Discovery ★★★

 === Core Result ===

 Group A (ARG-DENY): n=235 (80.2%) WR=25.5% mean_PnL=-1.20 sum=-281 ticks
 Group B (ARG-ALLOW): n=58 (19.8%) WR=94.8% mean_PnL=+9.22 sum=+535 ticks

 → ARG would improve: $1,270 → $2,675 (+$1,405)

 === Deny Reason Breakdown ===

 ENERGY_COLLAPSE: 89.4% of denies WR=17.6%
 FAILED_OPEN: 84.3% of denies WR=13.6%
 FCL_EARLY_DEATH: 37.9% of denies WR=1.1%
 AEP_DOWN_JUMP: 8.1% of denies WR=10.5%
 CLEAN_SHADOW_CONSECUTIVE: 23.4% of denies WR=30.9%

 === Depth Analysis (key/core) ===

 ≥1 reason: n=235 WR=25.5% mean_PnL=-1.20
 ≥2 reasons: n=190 WR=11.1% mean_PnL=-3.37
 ≥3 reasons: n=112 WR= 2.7% mean_PnL=-4.60

 → WR decreases exponentially as reasons overlap = irreversiblenature/property deep's/of directly Measurement

 === Deny by Fate ===

 STILLBORN: 100% deny (deny WR=0.0%) — perfect capture
 TERMINATED: 97.1% deny (deny WR=14.7%) — almost perfect capture
 ZOMBIE: 86.3% deny (deny WR=61.4%) — boundary existence
 IMMORTAL: 29.8% deny (deny WR=92.9%) — few/minorityonly error
 SURVIVED: 28.6% deny (deny WR=83.3%) — few/minorityonly error

 === Deny Bar Timing ===

 Entry deny (bar=0): n=64 WR=29.7% mean_PnL=-0.64
 Early deny (bar 1-3): n=147 WR=15.0% mean_PnL=-2.76
 Late deny (bar >3): n=24 WR=79.2% mean_PnL=+6.88

 → initial deny accurate. Late deny(bar>3) already survived alpha = false positive.

 === Hypothesis Tests ===

 H-39a SUPPORTED: ARG-DENY mean PnL = -1.20 ticks ('s/of expected value)

 H-39b NOT SUPPORTED: WR=25.5% (20% undecidedonly not)
 ★ more important Discovery: ≥2 reasonsfrom WR=11.1%, ≥3from WR=2.7%
 → single trades not... but "deep" irreversiblenature/property determination

 H-39c NOT SUPPORTED: Group B WR=94.8% (baseline 39.2%and mismatch)
 ★ This is most powerful Discovery:
 ARG-ALLOW baseline not... but "pure alpha solve"
 ARG exactly die alphaonly filtering those out, the rest are almost all victory
 → ARG filter not... but state separation

 H-39d NOT SUPPORTED: ZOMBIE deny WR=61.4%, mean_PnL=+4.07
 ★ ZOMBIE "denybecameonly " existence
 → ZOMBIE truly/real die what not... but boundaryfrom oscillationdo existence
 → EXP-30, 36, 38's/of ZOMBIE interpretationand perfect consistency

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:

 ═══ ARG filter not... but state separationwait ═══

 existing expected:
 - DENY = bad trade ('s/of EV)
 - ALLOW = usually trade (existing performance)

 actual Result:
 - DENY = die alpha (WR=25.5%, deepat following 2.7%until)
 - ALLOW = alive alpha (WR=94.8%)

 trades "is not 'keeping good trades'.
 trades "separating the living and the dead'.

 ═══ deep = irreversiblenature/property's/of directly Measurement ═══

 1reasons: may still be alive (WR=25.5%)
 2 keep: almost death (WR=11.1%)
 3 keep: effectively death confirmation (WR=2.7%)

 irreversibleoccurs not from a single event but from 'overlap'.
 This has exactly the same structure as 'ergodic breaking' in physics.

 ═══ ZOMBIE: boundary's/of physicsstudy ═══

 ZOMBIE deny WR = 61.4% (positive/amount's/of expected value)
 → ZOMBIE ARG "died"and DeterminationBut/However actualto/as boundaryfrom oscillation
 → This is consistent with EXP-38's 'ZOMBIE explosion at super-critical'
 → ZOMBIE Gate's/of judgment limit mark existence

 ═══ Counterfactual: $1,270 → $2,675 ═══
