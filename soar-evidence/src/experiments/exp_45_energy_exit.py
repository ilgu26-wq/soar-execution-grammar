EXP-45: ENERGY-CLOSED EXIT — death's/of physical definition
===================================================
"alpha energy if depleted natural extinctiondoes."

DEATH DEFINITION (4 simultaneous conditions):
 1. E_total < 0 (energy negative)
 2. dE/dt ≤ 0 (recovery Impossible)
 3. NOT PENUMBRA (boundary not)
 4. AOCL not leader (orbit support none)

 → 4 trades simultaneousat onlysatisfied alpha died
 → STOP/TP not — energy 0-crossingfrom natural extinction

RESULTS:
 === Natural Death Detection ===

 Energy death: 135 trades (46.1%)
 No death: 158 trades (53.9%)

 Death group: WR= 3.7% mean_PnL=-4.44 ← almost 100% defeat
 Alive group: WR=69.6% mean_PnL=+5.41

 Median death bar: 1 (most initialat death)
 Median post-death bars: 9 (die after 9bar during non-/fireNeededmake survival)

 === Death by Fate ===

 IMMORTAL: 0/47 died (0.0%) ← only/but one/a timealso energy death none
 SURVIVED: 0/21 died (0.0%) ← likewise
 ZOMBIE: 1/51 died (2.0%) ← almost not death (boundary existence)
 TERMINATED: 68/105 died (64.8%) ← majority death
 STILLBORN: 66/69 died (95.7%) ← almost all death

 → IMMORTAL energy deathrate 0.0% — perfect conservation

 === Exit Improvement ===

 Losers with death: 130
 Early death (bar≤2): 111 (85.4%)
 Total loss: 650 ticks
 Energy exit savings: 548 ticks (84.2%)
 → $2,738 potential savings

 Original Net: $1,270
 Energy-Exit Net: $4,008
 Improvement: +$2,738

 === Hypotheses ===

 H-45a SUPPORTED: Death WR=3.7% (< 30%)
 H-45b NOT SUPPORTED: Alive WR=69.6% (< 70% threshold)
 → 0.4% undecided. ZOMBIE included because. realever/instanceto/as boundary.
 H-45c SUPPORTED: Energy exit $4,008 > Original $1,270
 H-45d SUPPORTED: IMMORTAL death rate = 0.0%

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:

 ═══ energy death's/of physicsstudy ═══

 alpha's/of deathat 4's/of channel has and:
 - 4channel simultaneousat if closes irreversibleever/instanceto/as dies
 - IMMORTALnever experienced simultaneous closure of all 4 channels
 - STILLBORN 95.7% That isdeath

 most important number: median death bar = 1
 → most's/of defeat bar 1from already determinationdone/become
 → The 9 bars after that are 'residual time of an already dead trade'"

 ═══ $2,738's/of meaning ═══

 trades "more number/can exist money" not... but
 "money that leaked from already dead trades'.
