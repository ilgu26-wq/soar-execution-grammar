EXP-42: ZOMBIE SELECTION LEARNING
===================================================
"ZOMBIE die not... but boundaryfrom oscillationdo existence."

MOTIVATION:
 EXP-40: Graduated > ALLOW-only ($3,448 > $2,675)
 why? ZOMBIE because some have positive expected value.
 EXP-42: "must save will ZOMBIE"'s/of trades learningdoes.

DESIGN:
 ZOMBIE 51 trades featureper/starto/as analysis:
 - AEP Zone: SUB / CRIT / SUPER
 - Shadow Class: NO_SHADOW / PENUMBRA / FRACTURED / CLEAN
 - ARG Depth: ALLOW / D1 / D2 / D3+
 - Energy Slope: Rising / Falling

 SAVE trades (OR):
 - PENUMBRA or NO_SHADOW (shadowfrom light visible)
 - AEP SUPER-critical (energy sufficient)
 - Energy slope > 0 (recovery among)

RESULTS:
 === ZOMBIE Population ===

 Total: 51 WR=62.7% mean_PnL=+4.29

 === Feature Analysis ===

 AEP SUPER: WR=72.2% (n=18) — highest/best
 NO_SHADOW: WR=100% (n=5) — alive ZOMBIE
 Depth D1: WR=82.4% (n=17) — almost alive
 Depth D3+: WR=28.6% (n=7) — truly/real death

 Rising energy: WR=72.7% (n=22) — SAVE
 Falling energy: WR=55.2% (n=29) — boundary

 === Save vs Kill Decision ===

 SAVE: n=43 WR=62.8% mean_PnL=+4.28
 KILL: n=8 WR=62.5% mean_PnL=+4.38

 → H-42b NOT SUPPORTED: killed ZOMBIEalso WR=62.5%
 → This is ZOMBIE's essence: 'that which can completely kill ZOMBIE does not exist"

 === ZOMBIE-Enhanced Strategy ===

 Strategy n WR PF Net$ MaxDD
 Baseline 293 39.2% 1.29 $1,270 0.44%
 Graduated (EXP-40) 96 81.5% 9.05 $3,448 0.06%
 Learned (EXP-41) 118 73.6% 5.64 $3,539 0.09%
 ★ ZOMBIE-Enhanced 116 75.2% 6.10 $3,604 0.08%

 → before before among highest/best Net PnL ($3,604)

 === Hypothesis Tests ===

 H-42a SUPPORTED: Saved ZOMBIE WR=62.8% > 50%
 H-42b NOT SUPPORTED: Killed ZOMBIE WR=62.5% (not < 30%)
 ★ most important Discovery: ZOMBIE completely separation Impossible
 → This is boundary's physics: a structure analogous to quantum uncertainty
 H-42c SUPPORTED: ZOMBIE-Enhanced $3,604 > Graduated $3,448

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:

 ═══ ZOMBIE = determination system's/of quantum state ═══

 All other fates are clearly classified Possible:
 - IMMORTAL: certain lives
 - STILLBORN: certain dies
 - TERMINATED: almost certain dies

 ZOMBIEonly uniquely classification Impossible.
 This is Measurement Not a limitation but uncertainty of existence itself.

 ═══ profit's/of key/core ═══

 ZOMBIE 43 trades × average +4.28 ticks = +184 ticks = $920
 before profit $3,604 among 25.5% ZOMBIEfrom appears.
 "boundaryacknowledging strategy' is the key to profit.
