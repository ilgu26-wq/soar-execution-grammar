EXP-25: All-Alpha Census — before
=====================================
"Why only 68 became Lock, why the remaining 225 did not cross the threshold"

MOTIVATION:
 alpha layer completely anatomydoes.
 optimization not... but before death.
 all alphatreats equally and draws the map.

RESULTS:
 Money preserved:
 Net PnL: $1,200.00 [IDENTICAL]
 WR: 39.2% [IDENTICAL]
 PF: 1.28 [IDENTICAL]
 Max DD: 0.42% [IDENTICAL]
 Gate: UNTOUCHED

 === STEP 1: Alpha Census Table ===

 Fate n % WR PnL avg_life E_peak E_final
 IMMORTAL 47 16.0% 95.7% +$2,090 n/a +37.3 +36.3
 SURVIVED 21 7.2% 95.2% +$ 908 n/a +89.9 +87.6
 ZOMBIE 51 17.4% 62.7% +$1,040 4.2 bars +18.8 + 5.5
 TERMINATED 105 35.8% 17.1% -$1,213 2.3 bars +13.3 - 9.6
 STILLBORN 69 23.5% 0.0% -$1,625 1.1 bars -11.7 -39.2

 === STEP 2: Birth Phase Comparison ===

 "alphaWas it different from the start? — Yes, it was different from the start."

 Fate E(bar1) E(bar2) ΔE(1→2) E1>0%
 IMMORTAL +5.45 +13.32 +7.87 85.1%
 SURVIVED +18.57 +27.86 +9.29 100.0%
 ZOMBIE +4.49 +8.53 +4.04 60.8%
 TERMINATED +0.60 -2.48 -3.08 44.8%
 STILLBORN -14.39 -19.54 -5.14 0.0%

 Lock E(bar1): +9.50 (89.7% positive)
 NonLock E(bar1): -3.12 (34.7% positive)
 Gap: +12.62

 → Lock alpha bar 1from already +12.62 energy advantage.
 → SURVIVED bar 1from 100% positive/amount's/of energy (born whenfrom before).
 → STILLBORN bar 1from 100% 's/of energy (born whenfrom Impossible).

 === STEP 3: Energy Collapse Distribution ===

 "energy where lose?"

 TERMINATED: 93.3% collapse, mean bar 2.3, final E = -9.58
 ZOMBIE: 62.7% collapse, mean bar 3.8, final E = +5.51
 → ZOMBIE +15.08 more recovery (external energy injection)

 ZOMBIE vs SURVIVED:
 → SURVIVED has +71.0 higher peak, +583.0 more integral
 → energy The scale itself is different — not the same species.

 === STEP 4: Axis-Energy Phase Analysis ===

 "Lock energyis it? axisis it??"

 Fate AOCL_C% FCL_C% mean_ΔE mean_ΔO dom_move
 IMMORTAL 100.0% 0.0% +9.52 +0.560 ENERGY_NO_ORBIT
 SURVIVED 100.0% 100.0% +29.17 -0.020 ALPHA_LOCK
 ZOMBIE 100.0% 13.7% +4.00 +0.304 ENERGY_NO_ORBIT
 TERMINATED 61.0% 94.3% -1.26 -0.240 MIXED
 STILLBORN 0.0% 100.0% -7.05 +0.000 MIXED

 Lock: Energy precedes axis in 56/68 cases (82.4%)
 → energy first, axis follows.

 Critical findings:
 - IMMORTAL: AOCL 100%, FCL 0% → pure alpha orbit
 - SURVIVED: AOCL 100%, FCL 100% → both sides fired and survived
 - STILLBORN: AOCL 0%, FCL 100% → alpha orbit none
 - TERMINATED: AOCL 61%, FCL 94% → failure pressurealso

 === STEP 5: Lifecycle Flow Summary ===

 293 entries
 ├─ AOCL emerged: 183 (62.5%)
 │ ├─ IMMORTAL: 47 (25.7%)
 │ ├─ SURVIVED: 21 (11.5%)
 │ ├─ ZOMBIE: 51 (27.9%)
 │ └─ TERMINATED: 64 (35.0%)
 └─ No AOCL: 110 (37.5%)
 └─ STILLBORN: 69

 CONTESTED: 49
 ├─ ALPHA_LEANING: 29 → Lock 19 (65.5%), WR 100%
 └─ FAILURE_LEANING: 20 → Lock 0 (0%), WR 30%

FOUR QUESTIONS — ANSWERED:

 Q1. Lock alpha firstfrom was different?
 → YES. Gap = +12.62 at bar 1.
 → Lock E1>0 = 89.7%, NonLock E1>0 = 34.7%.
 → "Lock alpha born whenfrom energy falling born."

 Q2. FAILED/STILLBORN where energy lose?
 → TERMINATED: bar 2from negative (-2.48), 66.7% negative fixed.
 → STILLBORN: bar 1from already -14.39, 100% negative.
 → "TERMINATED bar 2from losing, STILLBORN firstfrom does not exist."

 Q3. ZOMBIE failure's/of speciesis it?, per/staralso's/of speciesis it??
 → A separate species. AOCL commit 100%, dominant orbit ALL ALPHA.
 → First leader: TIE(30), AOCL(17), FCL(4).
 → "ZOMBIE alphato/as was bornonly temporaryever/instanceto/as energy lose speciesis."

 Q4. CONTESTED boundaryis it? Delayed Lockis it??
 → Delayed Lock. ALPHA_LEANING → Lock 65.5%.
 → FAILURE_LEANING → Lock 0%.
 → "CONTESTED-ALPHAeventually becomes Lock. CONTESTED-FAILURE never becomes Lock."

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION:

 Census Proofone/a thing:

 1. alpha's/of fate/destiny bar 1from already determinationbecomes (initial trades determinationtheory)
 2. Lock energy first, axis follows (82.4%)
 3. ZOMBIE failure not... but per/staralso's/of life (AOCL 100%)
 4. CONTESTED-ALPHA Lock's/of delayed shape (65.5% Lock transition)
 5. STILLBORN physicalto/as existence Impossibleone/a alpha (E1 100% negative)
